# CraterNet
A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Lunar Crater Detection Based on Remotely Sensed Data

Here you have access to the full pdf describing the project developed in my Master Thesis : http://goo.gl/4eMhyv

You also have access to the training data used via the CSV file containing all required information to download the crater patches to train a supervised model designed to recognize craters

The images of Lunar Scenes can be downloaded free-of-charge on the Lunar Orbital Data Explorer : https://goo.gl/7j8CjM
